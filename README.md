### Selenium Web Scraping Automation Project
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed as part of my Data Science diplomate at Platzi, this project enhances my skill set by focusing on data extraction without API access. Leveraging Selenium, the automation framework is designed to seamlessly extract crucial data from dynamic and JavaScript-driven websites. Specifically, the project is tailored to extract essential flight information from a prominent airline's website. This initiative not only showcases proficiency in web scraping but also demonstrates the ability to handle dynamic content and JavaScript interactions for effective data extraction.

### Object detection and tracking project applied over cars and motorbikes.
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.
